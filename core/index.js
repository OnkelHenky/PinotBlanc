 * | Pinot gris is a white wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera.   |
 * | Thought to be a mutant clone of the Pinot noir variety, it normally has   |
 * | a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name                             |
 * | (gris meaning "gray" in French) but the grapes can have a brownish pink   |
 * | to black and even white appearance. The word pinot, which comes from the  |
 * | word meaning "pine cone" in French, could have been given to it because   |
 * | the grapes grow in small pine cone-shaped clusters. The wines produced    |
 * | from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper    |
 * | and even a light shade of pink                                            |
 * | The clone of Pinot gris grown in Italy is known as Pinot grigio.          |
